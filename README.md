# KUL-timer
A small timer webapp I made for a collague at KULeuven.

It is a normal timer but it has a repeat button. After the timer countdown a 40 second song plays and once it is done the timer starts again
It is made for small pitches of a set duration with 40 seconds to switch to the next speaker.
